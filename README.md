# Thyroid Disease Multi-Class Classification Model Deployment Using AWS SageMaker

This project demonstrates how to deploy a multi-class classification model for Thyroid Disease detection using AWS SageMaker. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, deployment to a real-time endpoint, and making predictions via the endpoint.

## üîç Project Overview

This project classifies patients into multiple thyroid-related categories using clinical and demographic features. The model is deployed using AWS SageMaker, enabling scalable and production-ready inference.

To understand the working of the model, feature selection, data preprocessing techniques, and interpretation of predictions, **refer to the published research paper associated with this project**.
