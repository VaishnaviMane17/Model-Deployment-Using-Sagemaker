# Thyroid Disease Multi-Class Classification Model Deployment Using AWS SageMaker

This project demonstrates how to deploy a multi-class classification model for Thyroid Disease detection using AWS SageMaker. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, deployment to a real-time endpoint, and making predictions via the endpoint.
